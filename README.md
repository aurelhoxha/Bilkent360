# Bilkent360
##DESCRIPTION:

Bilkent360 will be an Android application that will ease the lives of many students in Bilkent University. The application will serve to help the students to manage their schedule, events, personal task. The application will be user friendly and it will provide a feature where users can share picture from different spots in the university. User will be able to see the post shared by others and explore the spots. Moreover, since most of the mobile phones support GPS tracking system a service where user can find the university’s buildings will be provided. There are a lot of applications that provide some of the features that our application support. At this point we don’t deny the big help that these applications but Bilkent360 will be a mixture of personal and academic life. Every user who create their own account will have their own online identity. Since it is common to be sleepy and forget when the lesson starts another feature that the application is considered to support is to notify the users a certain time before the lesson and solve this problem. Bilkent360 team thought also for freshmen who don’t know the campus very well and find it very difficult to find the building they need to go. Showing their location on map and the location that they are required to go will be a great help for them. Using Bilkent360 application the users can have their own personal assistant right in their pocket. Our aim is to realize this idea and to extend the application with additional features.
